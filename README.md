## 📸 Screenshots

**Job List Page**

![Job List Page](screenshots/job_list.png)

This is the main page of the application, displaying a list of all job postings. The table includes information such as the job title, location, salary, and options to Update or Delete a job. A New Job button is available for adding new postings.

**Job Add Page**

![Job Add Page](screenshots/job_add.png)

The Job Add Page allows users to create new job postings by filling in details like the job title, location, description, and salary. Once filled, users can save the job, and it will appear on the Job List Page.

**Job Edit Page**

![Job Edit Page](screenshots/job_edit.png)

The Job Edit Page provides a form for updating an existing job's details. Users can modify fields like the title, location, description, or salary and save the changes.

**Job Delete Confirmation**

![Job Delete Confirmation](screenshots/job_delete.png)

When a user attempts to delete a job, a confirmation dialog appears to ensure the action is intentional. Users can confirm by clicking Yes or cancel by clicking Cancel.

**Job Deleted Success Notification**

![Job Deleted Success](screenshots/deleted_toast.png)

After successfully deleting a job, a green toast notification appears at the bottom-left corner, confirming the deletion. The same toast notification is displayed after completing any action.

**Responsive Design**

The application implements a fully responsive design to ensure an optimal user experience across various screen sizes. Below are some examples of the responsiveness:

- Table:

  - On larger screens, the table displays all columns clearly.
  - On smaller screens, a horizontal scroll is activated to maintain usability without truncating data.

    ![Table](screenshots/table_responsive_1.png)

    ![Table](screenshots/table_responsive_2.png)

- Form:

  - The form layout adapts dynamically based on the screen size.
  - On smaller screens, the form fields are stacked vertically, while on larger screens, the layout adjusts to a horizontal orientation for improved usability.

## 📌 Notes

- 🖌️ This application uses **Material-UI** for a responsive and clean UI.
- 🐘 Ensure **PostgreSQL** is running, and the database `jobs_db` is created before starting the backend.
- 🔗 **CORS** is configured to allow requests from `http://localhost:3000`.
